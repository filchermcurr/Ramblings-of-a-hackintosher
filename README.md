# INFO
Hi, I'm Pig. This is a fork of @camielverdult hackintosh guide, I will continue maintaining this guide for /r/hackintosh subreddit and people of hackintosh Discord server

# Install High Sierra on a hackintosh

You've read it, this guide/repo will guide you on how to install High Sierra to your desktop computer (laptop could work too, I am not going to do that in this guide though since laptops aren't in the general 
level of difficulty hackintoshing wise).

# Disclaimer

In this guide we don't cover AMD CPU's, this guide is primarily focussed around Intel CPU's

This guide is meant for desktop PC's, you could follow the same steps for laptops but most laptops will require extra patches and fixes.

We are not "professional" hackintoshers in any way. We know how to get a hackintosh working and we would like to spread our knowledge.

This guide is made by a few people. All have different opinions and different approaches.

# Some questions

## What is a hackintosh?

A hackintosh is a pc running MacOS. There is no actual "Hacking" involved as you might think because of the name. 

More info can be found [here](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-hackintosh-832719).

## How do I "make" a hackintosh?

You will need a list of your computer's specifications, a general idea of how an operating system works and a high pain tolerance.

More instructions [here](Pre-Install.md).

## Will you guide me through every single step personally?

I will not do this, please don't ask anyone but a good friend to do this for you. You can always ask for help from Discord server or anyone with some experience. Please don't be that person who wants his hand held through the process of this. If you want to get mac running the easy way, I recommend you check out [this](https://www.apple.com/mac/).

## Something broke/ isn't working (correctly)! What do I do?

I recommend you check out this page [here](Troubleshooting.md)
